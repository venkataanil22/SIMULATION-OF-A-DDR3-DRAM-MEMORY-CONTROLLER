# SIMULATION-OF-A-DDR3-DRAM-MEMORY-CONTROLLER
The general objective of the project is simulating a DDR3 DRAM memory controller where a single requestor (CPU) and a single memory channel as assumption. Incoming memory requests are placed in a queue of as many as 16 pending requests. When the queue is full, no further memory requests can be accepted until a memory request is completed. We implemented In-order, no access scheduling, open page policy for the simulation.
